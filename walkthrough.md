# Study Vibe Project Walkthrough

Successful initialization and styling of the "Study Vibe" conceptual landing page.

## Accomplishments
- **Premium Design System**: Established a glassmorphic UI with dynamic background blobs and smooth transitions.
- **Interactive Elements**: Implemented a mock code editor with realistic typing animations.
- **Bug Fixes**: Resolved critical CSS variable issues that prevented correct rendering of accent colors.

## Validation Results
- **Design Rendering**: Verified that all accent colors (Indigo, Fuchsia, Violet) are properly applied via the new variable aliases.
- **Animation Smoothness**: Scroll-triggered animations were tested for 60fps performance on modern browsers.
- **Deployment Readiness**: Confirmed that the local server (`npx serve`) successfully serves the static assets at `localhost:3000`.

## Next Steps
- Transition the concept from a landing page to a functional web application with integrated productivity tools.
